# Retail-Inventory-Management-Application
Capstone Project
Created using Java for cross-platform interoperability, Netbeans to construct the code, and Oracle SQL for the database structure.
Uses a database for inventory and a list of authorized users to assist management with products in stock, orders, sales, reports,
customer and vendor information, accounts payable and accounts receivable. The interface opens with a prompt for the user to log in,
at which point the menu appears to navigate through the different options.
